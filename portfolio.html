      <h2>Descent Into Space</h2>    
       <p class="about-me">This is a poster created for a school project, where we had to choose a movie and create your'e own movie poster. I chose <em>"Interstellar"</em>, because I knew that I had alot of good source material to work from, and I was so inspired by the flim.</p>

      <h2>The Magician's Secret</h2>

      <h2>Terminator 2 T-800</h2>    
        <p class="about-me">This is an illustration iv'e made inspired by the work of <em>Pablo Lobato</em>. I chose to do the T-800 from Terminator 2, because he is a fun character to draw, and I wanted to challenge myself in creating the likeness of <em>Arnold Schwarzenegger</em>. On the right of the illustration, is a toy design I created to show a different application of the original illustration. </p>

      <h2>Batman Illustration</h2>    
      <p class="about-me">This is a batman illustration inspired by an artist that I follow on instagram called <em>"Papyroo"</em>. I am a huge fan of his artwork, and so I reached out to him and asked him if I could create a piece that was in his style. He was very supportive and loved the end result, and hopefully one day do a collaberation.</p>

      <h2>Mr.Noodles Package Design</h2>    
      <p class="about-me">This is a concept package redesign that iv'e made for Mr.Noodles, that is clean and eye catching. I didnâ€™t want to make the packaging too fancy, because I wanted it to reflect the price point. The original package is very simple and has no art direction. I chose to make a character for Mr.Noodles, because I thought that it would add dimension to the design, and it can be something they can brand off of. I chose the color red, because it is appealing and eye catching.</p>

      <h2>Beardsley Illustration</h2>    
      <p class="about-me">Illustration piece done in the style of <em>Aubrey Beardsley</em>. I began by making a detailed sketch, then polished it in Illustrator. My goal was to emulate the Art Nouveau style in my Illustration, and pay close attention to Bearsley's style.</p>
