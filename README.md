##About Me

Hi there, my name is Nadim Abdelmalek, and I am junior Graphic Designer living in Ottawa,Ontario. I am currently a third year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I am primarly a visual designer and an illustrator. I entered the world of Graphic Design, because I wanted to make peoples lives easier, by creating designs and layouts that will help them in their day to day life. I also enjoy pop culture and so I enjoy creating posters that people can appreciate and enjoy.
